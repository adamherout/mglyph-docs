MGlyph library
==============

Malleable Glyph is a **small graphical design**, fitting exactly to a square of 1in Ã— 1in. It is **"shaped" by a numerical parameter** $x$ ranging from $0.0$ to $100.0$.

This is the `mglyph` library that offers an easy way how to design and preview malleable glyphs:

.. code:: python

   def simple_line(x: float, canvas:mg.Canvas) -> None:
       canvas.line((mg.lerp(x, 0, -1), 0), (mg.lerp(x, 0, 1), 0),
                  width='50p', color='navy', linecap='round')
   mg.show(simple_line)
